# CEGARBoxCPP

## Versions
I will be working on CEGARBoxCPP continuously throughout the year, so the master branch will change. Because of this I will create branches for each version of the tool.
For the submission to TABLEAUX2023, check the TABLEAUX2023 branch.

## Authorship
Robert McArthur and Cormac Kikkert, for contact email cormac.kikkert@anu.edu.au

## Dependencies
This project requires minisat installed to run and compile. Instruction for installing minisat are available [here](https://github.com/niklasso/minisat).

## Compile
A statically compiled file is already available in the repo - compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.3.

However, if you want to recreate our results, you will need to compile CEGARBoxCPP for your machine. To do this, follow the instructions below:

1. Install minisat. The main one doesn't work, so instead use this [fork](https://github.com/agurfinkel/minisat)
2. Install an ipasir compliant SAT solver, and put `libipasir.a` in `/Prover/IpasirProver/libipasir.a`. I use [cadical](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) but it doesn't matter, as Minisat was used for our experiments.
3. Remove the `-static` flag in the makefile
4. Run ``make`` to compile CEGARBox


## Input Formula
CEGARBox accepts file input. Input is terminated by a newline and valid input formula are defined by the following grammar:
```
Index ::= Nat || -Nat
Atom ::= Alphanumeric String
Formula ::=
 Atom || $true || $false || ~Formula ||
 [Index] Formula || <Index> Formula || []Formula || <>Formula || 
 Formula | Formula || Formula & Formula || Formula => Formula || 
 Formula <=> Formula || (Formula) 
```

Here, negative numbers are used to define converse for tense logic. For example ``[-1]`` is the converse of ``[1]``.

## Running CEGARBox 

``./main -f <input_file> [options]``

Options:

* Reflexivity: ``--reflexive`` or ``-t``
* Symmetry: ``--symmetric`` or ``-b``
* Transitivity: ``--transitive`` or ``-4``
* Seriality: ``--serial`` or ``-d``
* Euclidean: ``--euclidean`` or ``-e``
* Valid (whether input formula is valid): ``--valid`` or ``-a``
* Tense: ``--tense`` or `-n`
* Verbose: ``--verbose`` or `-v`

To use the local prover add `-l`
To use the global prover add `-g`
(Default is bespoke)

## Benchmarks

MQBF, 3CNF and LWB_K benchmarks can be downloaded from [here](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~montmirail/mosaic/#)
ALC benchmarks can be downloaded from [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190305011522/http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rpg/BDDTab/)

## Examples
Some examples to see how to use the tool are in `Examples`.

Note: logics besides K, KD, KT, KB, K4, K5, and tense are untested, and may not work.
Also, we have not extensively tested multimodal logics either - the standard benchmarks are all monomodal
